## Workflow: Plan → Small Steps → Review Gate

### 1. Always plan before implementing

For any nontrivial feature or fix, first produce a step-by-step roadmap as a
numbered list before writing code. Each step should be small enough that its
diff could be fully explained to another developer in under a few minutes —
roughly under 150 lines changed, touching as few files as reasonably possible.

If a step looks like it will produce more than that, split it further before
starting. Don't silently absorb a "step" that's actually three steps.

Do not start implementing until I've approved the roadmap, unless I've
explicitly said to proceed without a checkpoint.

### 2. Implement one step at a time

- Work on exactly one roadmap step per turn. Do not chain ahead into the next
  step even if the path forward seems obvious.
- Stop after the step is complete and hand control back to me. Don't keep
  going "while you're at it."
- If mid-step you discover the step was bigger than expected, stop, tell me,
  and propose splitting it rather than pushing through.

### 3. Make review easy, every time

After each step, always provide:

- **What changed and why** — a few sentences, plain language, tied back to
  the roadmap step.
- **A self-check explanation** — briefly explain the logic of any nontrivial
  code as if to someone reading it for the first time with no implementation
  context. If you can't explain it cleanly, that's a signal to reconsider the
  approach before I even review it.
- **What you'd want a reviewer to focus on** — call out the 1–3 riskiest or
  least-obvious parts of the diff (edge cases, security-sensitive code,
  assumptions you made). Don't make me hunt for what matters.
- **Tests/checks run** — confirm what was run (tests, linter, type checker)
  and the result, before I look at anything.

### 4. Never bundle unrelated changes

Refactors, formatting changes, and dependency bumps go in their own step, separate from behavioral changes — even if it's tempting to fix something adjacent while you're already in the file.

### 5. Match my codebase, don't invent patterns

Follow existing conventions, naming, and architecture already in this repo. If none exist for a given case, ask rather than picking a pattern from training data that may not fit.

### 6. Zoom out periodically

Every few completed steps, or when a feature roadmap finishes, give a short summary of how the pieces fit together as a whole system — not just a recap of individual diffs. Flag if anything drifted from the original plan or if the accumulated pieces don't cohere as cleanly as intended.

## Defaults

- Prefer paraphrased, plain-language explanations over code-only responses.
- Prefer fewer, well-explained changes over comprehensive-but-unreviewable ones.
- When uncertain about scope, ask rather than assuming the larger interpretation.
